ArrayArrayLinear´An array is a collection of items of the same data type. Arrays work by having multiple indexes, starting at 0. Each index can have one item, such as an integer or string.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-LinearzEach node has at most two children where the left child contains values less than its parent, and the right contains more.GraphGraphs
Non-LinearöNodes that are connected by edges that is used to describe relationships between different entities. Commonly used to find the shortest path, for example.
Hash TableHash
Non-LinearõA data structure where keys and values are matched up. Keys are translated into an index in an array. This index works for finding the corresponding value.HeapTree
Non-LinearmA complete binary tree that for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value.Linked ListListLinearèA linked list is a structure of nodes where each node contains both data and a reference that indicates which node is the next in the sequence.ListListLinearÑA finite number of ordered values where values may occur more than once. If multiple values exist, they are their own distinct term.QueueAbstractLinear∑A queue works off first in, first out so only the least recent additions could be removed or accessed, and you would have to go through the entire queue to access what was just added.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearìA height balanced binary search tree. The height will be automatically adjusted to be as small as possible whenever additions or removals are made.SetAbstract
Non-LinearÅA set is a collection of unique elements that does not allow for any duplicate values. These elements can be stored in any order.StackAbstractLinearÅA linear data structure where only the top element can be accessed. i.e. values that are added and removed are always at the top.Two Dimensional ArrayArrayLinearêA two-dimensional array is an array of arrays. They can be accessed with 2 indices such as [3][4] which would be the 4th row and the 5th column.
